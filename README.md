# Android PWA App
This is the official beestat Android app. 

Beestat is a PWA (Progressive Web App). This means that there is very little native Android code. If you're here looking for something meaningful, you're not going to find it. This app is nothing more than a pointer at beestat.io for presence in the Play Store.

A PWA works by:
- Opening Chrome on the device
- Navigating to a desired website
- Hiding the address bar

It's basically just a refined way of creating a "wrapper" application using a WebView. It has a lot of advantages and is a lot cleaner.

This application was created with the PWA to APK service from appmaker.xyz (https://appmaker.xyz/pwa-to-apk/), which is mostly just an automated tool that configures the example app from Google (https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/svgomg-twa). I've done some fiddling with the source code as I attempted to understand what was going on and then rebuilt the app using Android Studio.
